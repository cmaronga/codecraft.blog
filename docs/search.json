    "text": "MySQL, SQLite, R\nThis blog post comes as a follow-up to a successful online training session jointly organized by NairobiR and RLadies on June 12, 2021. If you missed the session, you can view the recording on this YouTube link\nIn both the video and this accompanying blog, I delve into the fundamental principles of establishing dynamic connections and extracting data from databases using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Regardless of how and where data is stored, the initial step in any data management process involves loading it into your preferred working tool.\nRelational databases, such as RMySQL, and web-based databases, like REDCap, have gained popularity for efficiently and cost-effectively managing small to medium-sized datasets. In this blog, Iâ€™ll guide you through the essential steps to access and utilize data stored in these platforms using the R statistical language. I will provide practical examples to demonstrate:\n\nEstablishing an efficient connection between R and Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS).\nQuerying data housed in any RDBMS directly from within R/RStudio.\nConnecting to and querying data from a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database.\nBest practices for securing your API while collaborating on projects.\n\nPlease note that this blog is a work in progress. In the meantime, you can access the workshop slides for reference here and the youtube link should be resourceful since this was a live coding exercise.\nI also delivered a similar workshop at NHS-R conference in 2022, the workshop materials can be found here, while the recorded workshop video can be accessed in this YouTube link."

    "text": "Introduction\nData management in multi-centre cohort studies presents unique challenges, particularly when these study sites are widely dispersed geographically and possess varying levels of technical and human resources. It is crucial to maintain data quality, promptly address data inconsistencies, and generate timely progress reports. This is especially true for initiatives like the Childhood Acute Illness and Nutrition Network (CHAIN), which involved recruiting participants from nine hospitals located in Africa and Asia. The CHAIN study collected highly detailed data spanning various biological and social domains."

    "text": "Methods\nTo streamline data management processes, the CHAIN cohort employed Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), a web-based, open-source database driven by metadata. In this article, I describe our effective utilization of REDCap in combination with the open-source R software to automate the data management workflow for the CHAIN study. I aim to document, step by step, the various decisions and implementations that were instrumental in this process. I plan to make this information available on my webpage for others to read and implement, although this will require a few days to compile and potentially create informative infographics.\nAdditionally, I had the opportunity to present this work at the Why R conference in 2021, and you can watch the presentation on YouTube. The presentation slides are also accessible here for download\nI hope after watching the conference presentation, you shall an idea how this was set up. I am working toward presenting this work as a guideline, untill then, pleas be patient and if you have any questions, feel free to reach me via e-mai."

    "text": "My word\nI canâ€™t help but feel a sense of pride and great accomplishment as the year comes to an end. In 2023, I committed to fitness goals which involved gym weight-lifting and outdoor running exercises, targeting at least 11km each weekend (spoiler: I only did 22km, ~ approximately 2 weekends), nevertheless, the results is a whooping 100 days of hard-work, dedication and near addiction to gym work-out.\nIn this short article, I will share my 100 days journey, motivations and the lessons I have picked up in the process.\n\n# Load packages for session\npacman::p_load(\n  lubridate,  # handle and manage dates\n  flextable,  # for quick and neat tables\n  ggthemes,    # ggplot2 themes extension\n  tidyverse   # data wrangling and viz\n)\n\n# set theme for ggplot2\ntheme_set(\n  theme_hc(base_size = 18) +                  # base size\n    theme(\n      legend.position = \"none\",              # No legend, unless specified in the plot\n      legend.title = element_blank(),         # No title on the legend\n      axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 90) # spin y title 90 degrees\n    )\n)\n\nThe below code below utilize the tribble function to create row-wise tibble of the workout data for the months beggining January 2023 to my celebration month and date.\n\n# Creating tibble for monthly workout counts\n# used to visualize in the latter sections\nworkout_df &lt;- tribble(\n  ~ month, ~n_workouts,\n  \"2023-01\", 14 ,\n  \"2023-02\", 13,\n  \"2023-03\",05 ,\n  \"2023-04\", 0,\n  \"2023-05\",02 ,\n  \"2023-06\",14 ,\n  \"2023-07\", 23,\n  \"2023-08\", 15,\n  \"2023-09\",0 ,\n  \"2023-10\", 14\n)\n\n# data processing\nworkout_df &lt;- workout_df %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    month = ym(month),\n    n_workouts = as.integer(n_workouts)\n  )\n\nIt all began with setting some realistic and achievable goals. When you are working towards a plan, you get a clear compass and guiding light that keeps you focused all the time. Some of the goals I set and working towards are:-\n\nImprove my muscle strength [full body muscles]\nBuild endurance\nOverall fitness\n\n\nworkout_df %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = n_workouts, group = 1)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = n_workouts)) +   # size of point depends on number of workouts\n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.8) +\n  labs(title = \"Trend of monthly gym workouts\",\n       subtitle = \"Past 10 months only\",\n       x = \"Month\", y = \"No. of workouts\")+\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"month\",    # break by 1 month interval\n               date_labels = \"%b\")       # show only month of the year\n\n\n\n\nFigureÂ 1: Monthly Gym workouts\n\n\n\n\nFigureÂ 1 shows a trend of monthly workouts, with my worst efforts in the months of March and May (I have an excuse though ðŸ˜‚). I reached by best efforts in the month of July with a total of 23 gym works in that monthly only ðŸ˜°, never managed to replicate that effort, it has now since become my other additional goal, you see how it works now?\n\nworkout_df %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(y = n_workouts, x = factor(1))) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2) +\n  labs(title = \"The overal picture\",\n       x = \"\", y = \"No. of workouts\")\n\n\n\n\nFigureÂ 2: Workout summary\n\n\n\n\nI averaged 10 workouts per month during the 10 months period (despite registering 0 in April and May) FigureÂ 2. I registered a median of 13 workouts per month, not bad for a beginner though, proud of these numbers to the greatest heights."

Overcoming this type of challenge was key to my success, made me mentally stronger and enabled me to become more resilient.\nListen to your body always, know when to push harder and when to rest. Celebrate every milestone you have achieved, even if it meant you listed 2.5kg extra. Celebrations makes you more energetic and looking forward to move up next level the following workout day.\nI hope my story inspires you to start your fitness journey or continue the one you already archived. Itâ€™s doable, if you put mind to it. Here is to 100 days of hard-work, dedication and determination ðŸ™ŒðŸ¥³"
